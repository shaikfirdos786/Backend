                To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by the American author Harper
                Lee. It was published in 1960 and was instantly successful. In
                the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle
                schools. To Kill a Mockingbird has become a classic of modern
                American literature; a year after its release, it won the
                Pulitzer Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based on
                Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event
                that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in
                1936, when she was ten.
